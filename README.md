# Housing-Sentiment-App

## Description
A full-stack app developed as an academic project in a scrum team with cohorts. Stack: React, Node.js, MongoDB. Our team used Reddit and Google Trends APIs to pull data (in the form of forum posts) regarding housing sentiment based on select keywords we chose. We generated dynamic visualizations include a histogram and word cloud using Chart.js and react d3 cloud respectively.\

The home page features a jumbotron that displays the current number of Reddit posts stored in the database. Additionally, each time the page is loaded a random post from the database is displayed.\

The navigation bar allows users to move to the histogram and word cloud pages. The histogram is interactive - users can select which keywords to filter by and the histogram will display the number of posts stored in the database that contain that keyword.

## Limitations
